    makefile - compiles all of the program files into a single executable "shell". 

    main.c - Prompts the user for new commands/input from the user and calls the appropriate functions based on the
              the user's input. Shell.c also keeps track of the number of background processes and the total number
              of commands executed since the program started. 

    parser.h - Header file for parser.c

    parser.c - Implementation of parsing functions that allow for input to be easily
               tokenized. 

How to compile executables with Makefile
    When the makefile is run with "make" the executable "project3" will be created. The executable will launch the program.
