COP4610 Project 3 - Project_3_FAT32

Team Members: Aria Delmar, Alec Amico, Alvaro Reyes

Division of Labor:
    Aria: exit, info, size, ls, cd, open, close, lseek, read, write
    Alec: info, creat, mkdir
    Alvaro: size, mv, open, close, lseek

Contents of tar archive:
    makefile - compiles all of the program files into a single executable "project3". 

    main.c - Prompts the user for new commands/input from the user and calls the appropriate functions based on the
             the user's input. 

    parser.h - Header file for parser.c

    parser.c - Implementation of parsing functions that allow for input to be easily
               tokenized. 

How to compile executables with Makefile
    When the makefile is run with "make" the executable "project3" will be created. An argument should be provided for
    the path to the image file. Ex: "project3 fat32.img" will launch the program with fat32.img as the image file to 
    navigate.

Known bugs/unfinished project parts: 
    exit:
        - no known bugs
    size:
        - if size has been increased with a write, this will not be reflected
        - fixing this would recquire implmenting a function that goes to bytes where the size of the file is specified and writing
          over them with the new size
    ls:
        - no known bugs
    cd:
        - no known bugs
    creat:
        - "creat" will only create a directory entry with the appropriate filename that will show up with ls. This file 
          cannot be opened/closed and therefore cannot be read from or written to. 
        - fixing this requires more time to be spent creating the appropriate DIRENTRY
    mkdir:
        - no known bugs
    mv:
        - is not fully implemented (explained below)
    open:
        - file created with "creat" function cannot be opened
    close:
        - no known bugs
    lseek:
        - no know bugs
    read:
        - no know bugs
    write:
        - the file size does not update as the file is written to
        
        - More clusters cannot be allocated for writes that recquire them. If the write requires more clusters be allocated 
          for the file, the number of additional clusters needed will be calculated and displayed. But, the size of the write
          will be reduced to the amount of remaining space in the file.
        - implementing this woudl recquire a function to create a new cluster, change the previous reference for the end of the data
          in the fat to a reference to the new last cluster number. If this is done appropriately the write function should function
          appropriately with the new cluster.     
    rm:
        - does not recognize the last entry in a directory
    cp:
        - is not fully implemented (explained below)
      
Unfinished Parts:
    - mv only renames items in the current directory, does not mv files to a new directory
    - rm does not recognize the last entry in a directory and sets the first bit to 0xE5 as well    
    - cp only has error checking for the syntax of the provided command but will not actually implement any kind of copy

Extra credit documentation:
    There is some error checking for rmdir. It will check if DIRECTORY is a directory or not and if some of the necessary 
    operands are missing.
